The first thing you shuld do i create a reademe file which containd a description of your directory and all the projects
to complete withh all tasks of these project follow the steps i'll show you and see the whole video in order to have no errors
to do all the projects use cat > file_name then write the code after clicking enter when finished click enetr and to stop writting use ctrl+c.
i'll show you with vi editor because it's more likely simple for me to show but for you to write use cat
